## Notice! This is a beta extension.

This extension is in active development and may contain bugs.

If you notice anything off, or have feature requests, please reach out on GitHub or Slack.

## Features

- Auto load a canvas on pages that match your patterns (default: `Canvas/*`)
- Works in both the main view and right sidebar
- Adds dedicated Page and Block node tools to the tldraw toolbar
- Supports paste and drag/drop of links and block refs directly onto the canvas
- Includes a searchable inspector for picking target pages or blocks
- Opens linked items in the main view (`Ctrl+click`) or sidebar (`Shift+click`)
- Provides a configurable maximize hotkey for full-screen focus

## Quick Start

The default canvas page pattern is `Canvas/*`.

To create a canvas, create a page with a title like:

- `Canvas/Project Planning`
- `Canvas/Ideas`

When you open that page, the canvas loads automatically.
